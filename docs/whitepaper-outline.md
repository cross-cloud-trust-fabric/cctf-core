# Cross-Cloud Trust Fabric (CCTF) ‚Äì Whitepaper Outline

## 1. Executive Summary
Brief overview of why CCTF exists:
- Growing multi-cloud complexity.
- DNS and identity fragmentation.
- Quantum-era encryption risks.

## 2. Problem Definition
- The limitations of DNSSEC, mTLS, and OIDC when used independently.
- Cross-provider trust issues in hybrid and multi-cloud systems.
- The need for a federated trust layer that survives DNS or PKI outages.

## 3. Research Background
- RFC references: 4033‚Äì4035 (DNSSEC), 5280 (X.509), 6749 (OAuth 2.0), and 8414 (OIDC discovery).
- Quantum threat: NIST PQC algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium).
- Existing industry efforts (SPIFFE/SPIRE, Zero Trust, BeyondCorp).

## 4. Architecture Overview
- High-level system diagram: resolver quorum ‚Üí trust negotiator ‚Üí crypto agility layer.
- Core components:
  - Resolver Quorum Engine
  - Identity Federation Layer
  - Trust Negotiator
  - AI Policy Engine
  - Telemetry

## 5. Core Algorithms
- Resolver voting logic (3-of-5 quorum).
- Last-Known-Good (LKG) attestation caching.
- Multi-path validation pipeline.

## 6. Implementation Plan
- Prototype stack: Python (FastAPI), OpenTelemetry, Open Quantum Safe (liboqs).
- Environment support: AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle.
- Integration testing through simulated DNS degradation.

## 7. Security Model
- Threat analysis: replay, downgrade, poisoning.
- Mitigations: nonce-based validation, short TTLs, cryptographic rotation.

## 8. Future Work
- Cross-Cloud Council formation for interoperability standards.
- PQC key rotation best practices.
- Integration with Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape.
