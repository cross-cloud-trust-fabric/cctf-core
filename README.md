## 1. Vision & Purpose
The **Cross-Cloud Trust Fabric (CCTF)** is a federated security and reliability framework created to keep multi-cloud systems communicating securely even when DNS or certificate propagation fails.  
It establishes multi-path trust validation — **DNSSEC + mTLS + OIDC** — and prepares infrastructures for **post-quantum cryptography**.  
The project promotes **open collaboration** while maintaining **sustainable ownership and licensing**, ensuring innovation grows responsibly and the founder is fairly compensated.

## 2. Problem Statement
1. DNS has evolved from simple routing to a critical trust anchor.  
2. When DNS trust breaks, software security logic halts communication *by design.*  
3. Adding redundant resolvers does not equal true resilience.  
4. Each cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle) uses distinct IAM and PKI models, fragmenting trust.  
5. Quantum computing is approaching the point where RSA / ECC encryption may be compromised.

---

## 3. Solution Overview
The Cross-Cloud Trust Fabric provides a cross-provider **trust fabric** that:

- Validates workload identity through multiple independent trust paths.  
- Maintains short-lived, cryptographically signed **Last-Known-Good (LKG)** attestations during DNS degradation.  
- Implements **AI-assisted self-healing** and policy-driven safe modes.  
- Introduces **quantum-ready crypto agility** to future-proof key exchange and validation.

## 4. Core Architecture (MVP Scope)

| Layer | Purpose | Example Technologies |
|:------|:---------|:---------------------|
| **Resolver Quorum Engine** | Vote across multiple resolvers to prevent split-horizon errors | Route 53, Azure DNS, Cloud DNS |
| **Identity Federation** | Normalize IAM tokens into signed claims | SPIFFE / SPIRE, OIDC |
| **Trust Negotiator** | Confirm ≥ 2 of 3 trust paths (DNSSEC, mTLS, OIDC) | Python FastAPI service |
| **AI Policy Engine** | Detect anomalies and trigger safe-mode | LangChain / Rule-based |
| **Crypto-Agility Layer** | Hybrid PQC + classical keys | Open Quantum Safe (OQS) |
| **Telemetry** | Expose trust-health metrics | OpenTelemetry, Grafana |

---

## 5. Security Design Principles
- No new root CAs or trust anchors introduced.  
- Metadata-only data exchange.  
- Strict TTL and re-attestation for cached trust.  
- Resolver quorum (3-of-5 vote rule).  
- Crypto agility for PQC migration.  
- Full audit trail via OpenTelemetry.

## 6. Roadmap and Order of Work

| Phase | Description | Timeline / Goal |
|:------|:-------------|:---------------|
| **1 – Research & Design** | Draft whitepaper and architecture diagrams; define schema and glossary. | Weeks 1 – 4 |
| **2 – Build MVP Prototype** | Implement resolver quorum + SPIFFE integration; basic logging and PQC abstraction. | Weeks 5 – 12 |
| **3 – Public Release** | Publish GitHub repo and overview article “Trust Is the New Uptime.” | Weeks 13 – 16 |
| **4 – Early Collaboration** | Gather peer feedback, code reviews, and pilot tests. | Weeks 17 – 20 |
| **5 – Cross-Cloud Council Formation** | Establish working group after MVP success to shape interoperability standards. | Post-Prototype |
| **6 – Commercialization & Sustainability** | Finalize dual-license model and enterprise support offerings. | Ongoing |

## 7. Testing Targets
- **Chaos:** DNS blackhole, TTL mismatch, certificate drift.  
- **Security:** Replay, downgrade, resolver poisoning.  
- **Performance:** < 10 ms overhead.  
- **Resilience:** ≥ 99.999 % trust integrity during DNS loss.

---

## 8. Security Concerns & Mitigations
- **Single Point of Failure:** Avoided via federated quorum.  
- **Cache Abuse:** Short-TTL signed LKG plus alerting.  
- **Downgrade / Replay Attacks:** Anti-downgrade flag and fresh nonce requirements.  
- **Secret Sprawl:** All keys in provider KMS.  
- **Privacy:** No payload data; metadata hashes only.  
- **Geo-Boundaries:** Regional pinning for compliance and legal isolation.
